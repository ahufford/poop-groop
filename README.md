## Vision Statement

This application is being built with the newcomer UCF student or employee in mind. Navigating campus can be hard without much aid. There are many sideroads, exits, and buildings in between to easily get lost in. Our app, KnightsMap, will help newer students and employees navigate the campus with ease through the use of AR. That leads to less time spent figuring out which building you are looking at and following 2D maps and more time just simply going to your destination.
Unlike the current Google Maps, which does offer walking instructions, KnightsMap will be tailored specifically to UCF and use AR to make walking through campus easier than ever. Our product offers on-screen arrows to tell you where to go, tapping on buildings to immediately get information at where you are and what you are looking at, and the ability to still see in front of you while looking at directions, never having to look down or away from the foot traffic.
